# ChromoDetect: Unraveling Genetic Mysteries with AI - Karyotype Abnormality Detection

Welcome to the ChromoDetect project, "Unraveling Genetic Mysteries with AI - Karyotype Abnormality Detection." In this README, we will provide an overview of the project's phases, objectives, and methodologies. Our mission is to revolutionize the field of cytogenetics by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to automate the detection of chromosomal abnormalities within karyotype images.

## Phase 0: Project Inception and Data Preparation

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
To initiate this project, we will acquire karyotype image data from publicly available datasets, such as the Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/code/stpeteishii/chromosomes-image-segment-anything/input). These images may require resizing, annotation, and augmentation to ensure data quality.

### 2. Chromosome Segmentation and ROI Extraction
Chromosome segmentation will be a crucial step. We will explore existing models and potentially develop custom ones to accurately segment chromosomes within karyotype images. Our aim is to extract individual chromosomes as separate objects efficiently.

### 3. Feature Extraction
We plan to employ advanced feature extraction techniques to capture the distinguishing characteristics of segmented chromosomes. This may include methods such as wavelet transformations and Fourier analysis to enhance feature representation.

### 4. Labeling and Annotation
To label the segmented chromosomes as normal or exhibiting specific abnormalities, we may engage expert geneticists or cytogeneticists. Their expertise will be invaluable in ensuring accurate annotations.

### 5. Data Splitting and Model Selection
We will split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to train and evaluate our models. Model selection will be based on the specific requirements of our classification task, and we will explore the possibility of using transfer learning.

### 6. Model Training and Hyper-parameter Tuning
Our training strategy will include data augmentation and batch normalization to improve model robustness. Hyper-parameter tuning will be conducted to optimize model performance and prevent overfitting.

### 7. Evaluation and Performance Metrics
We will evaluate our model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices will be generated to visualize classification results effectively.

### 8. Post-processing Techniques
To refine the model's output, we will implement post-processing techniques, which may include filtering out false positives or using voting mechanisms to enhance accuracy.

### 9. Deployment and User Interface (if applicable)
If applicable, we will create a practical application for our AI model and design a user-friendly interface to facilitate its use by healthcare professionals.

### 10. Ethical Considerations and Data Privacy
We are committed to ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations and ethical guidelines throughout the project. Patient data will be anonymized and treated with the utmost confidentiality.

### 11. Validation and Expert Collaboration
Validation of our model's performance on new, unseen data will be a priority. Collaboration with domain experts, including geneticists and cytogeneticists, will be sought to validate our AI-driven karyotype abnormality detection.

### 12. Documentation and Reporting
Comprehensive documentation will be maintained throughout the project, including details about the dataset, model architecture, training process, and evaluation results. This documentation will ensure transparency and reproducibility.

### 13. Timeline and Milestones
We have established a timeline that outlines the estimated duration of each project phase and the milestones we aim to achieve. Regular updates will be provided to stakeholders.

### 14. Risks and Contingency Plans
We have identified potential challenges and risks that may arise during the project and outlined contingency plans for addressing them, ensuring project continuity and success.

## Introduction

Karyotypes, which provide visual representations of a cell's chromosome composition, are indispensable tools in medical diagnostics. They play critical roles in pregnancy screening, leukemia diagnosis, and genetic disorder risk assessment. Chromosome karyotyping involves the segmentation and classification of individual chromosomes, traditionally performed manually by cytogeneticists.

Our project, ChromoDetect, leverages artificial intelligence to automate this labor-intensive and time-consuming process. By integrating cutting-edge image processing techniques, advanced machine learning algorithms, and a comprehensive karyotype image dataset, we aim to create a tool that aids healthcare professionals in early disease detection, genetic counseling, and personalized medicine.

We invite you to join us on this transformative journey as we unravel genetic mysteries and usher in a future where AI and human expertise collaborate to advance healthcare and genetics.

## Data Source
For our project, we will utilize the karyotype image dataset available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/stpeteishii/chromosomes-image-segment-anything/input).

Thank you for your interest in ChromoDetect. We look forward to making significant strides in the field of cytogenetics through the power of artificial intelligence.
